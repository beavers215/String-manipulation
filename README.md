String Manipulation Assignment

This Java program performs various string manipulation tasks on a given input string. The tasks include:

1. Reverse String:
   - Reverses the input string.

2. Count Vowels:
   - Counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input string.

3. Palindrome Check:
   - Counts the number of palindromes in the input string. Palindromes are words that read the same backward as forward.

4. Word Count:
   - Counts the number of words in the input string.

5. Find Maximum Occurring Character:
   - Determines the character that occurs most frequently in the input string.

Usage:
- The main method of the StringManipulationAssignment class demonstrates how to use each functionality with an example input string.
- Compile and run the program to see the results of each task.

Implementation Notes:
- The program utilizes Java's built-in String manipulation methods, loops, and data structures such as HashMap to achieve the desired functionality.
- Each task is implemented as a separate method within the StringManipulationAssignment class.
- Proper comments and variable names are used to improve code readability and maintainability.
